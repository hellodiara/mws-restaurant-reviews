## Project Overview: 
This project is #5 of the Udacity FEND Nanodegree. We were provided an existing site to alter for responsiveness, accessibility and tasked to add a service worker for offline viewing.

## Live View
Here is the link to view the live site: https://hellodiara.github.io/mws-restaurant-reviews/

## Project Requirements:
* Convert a static design that lacks accessibility to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. 
	* Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used; all responsiveness should be done with CSS
	* Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags
	* Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS
	* Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes
	* Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device
* Implement accessibility features in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions).
* Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline. Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.
You may use external JavaScript libraries, but UI frameworks may not be used. This includes (but is not limited to) jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, etc.
